## Conway's Game Of Life
This program is a React application that implements Conway's Game of Life. It features a grid where each cell can be alive or dead. The grid evolves over time based on specific rules: a cell's state in the next generation depends on the number of alive neighbors it has. The application includes buttons to start/stop the simulation, reset the grid with random states, and clear the grid. The grid and buttons are styled using CSS, and the layout is responsive to different screen sizes.

## Features

- Start/Stop the simulation
- Reset the grid with random states
- Clear the grid
- Responsive design
